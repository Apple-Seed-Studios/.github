- Rhea: Analysis, research, humor
- Jordan: Baseless confidence
- Robert: Testing
- Adrian: Big picture

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

The team has a well-rounded balance of competencies and technical expertise to execute the various objectives of our project. Divide and conquer. Mass Fires.

- Rhea: I can help with planning and with identifying and forecasting future problems or barriers
- Jordan: Willing to try, and learn about the new technologies. Smooths problems with other team members.
- Robert: Creates the tests that will ensure the capabilities of our application.
- Adrian: Helps develop the foundation of the application.

- Robert: Whiteboarding and communication.
- Jordan: Make a careful deadline.

- **Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

Start the day with clear objectives for each person, and a clear picture of what is to be done by the end of each day. Whiteboard it out!

## Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

Settle with one on one if possible, if not mediation with a neutral party. Work on first understanding each other's perspectives before attempting to push through to a 'solution'.
 
- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**
 
Settle one on one, and ensure that not only is everyone able to contribute, but that we are going out of our way for contribution from everyone. Open Communication is important. Understand *why* they've been assuming control and how we can all address that concern.

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

Treat this as a learning environment for everyone involved. The stakes are low here. If/when we feel left out or out of place, we'll empathize with eachother's unmet needs. Pair Programming to help areas team members are deficient in. 

- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

Settle one on one, if not able to settle bring in mediation. Be realistic about your skills, and what you can accomplish without or with help.

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

Assuming an agreement is not able to be made. It will be up to the other group members to come to a decision on what to do.
 
## Communication Plan

- **What hours will you be available to communicate?**

Whole team 9-6PM, unless otherwise specified.(Very likely) What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? This Friday ensure everyone has a clear idea on what everyone else is doing for features that weekend.
Slack will be the main method of communication, phones will be a last means.

- **How often will you take breaks?**

12-1 lunch time. Every hour for 15 minutes. 

- **What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

Team meeting to decide on what the most appropriate course of action is. Mob coding to complete main features. Trello board will contain timelines.

- **How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

Slack for after hours, and on the weekend.

- **What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

Everyone needs to give updates on their specific portion of the code each morning. Check in at mid-day to check up on everyone.

- **How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

Everyone provides constructive feedback, with areas to improve in an area of no judgement.

## Work Plan

- **How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

Beginning of the day meeting for division of work, and where to work once their division of work is complete. Ask for help, don't stay stuck. 

- **What project management tool will be used?**

Todoist will be our project management tool.

## Git process

- **What components of your project will live on GitHub?**

Back-End and possibly a simple front-end. 

- **How will you share the repository with your teammates?**

We are using organization on Github.

- **What is your Git flow?**

Utilize a `main` branch to be the source of thrugh, as well as a `dev-branch` that'll we'll pull individual `feature branches`. PRs will be from `features branches` to the `dev-branch` and when ready for production, to the `main` branch. Ensure we are using test driven development for our entire project.

We'll utilize atomic commits to share and create a history of what we're currently working on.
