# Vision  

Our project will be a productivity app. Users will be able to keep track of tasks, and set a pomodoro timer to keep them focused on work.
There are a lot of productivity apps, however many that involve time tracking features are only aimed at freelance workers. Keeping track of the time a user has 
spent working keeps them honest with themselves.  

## Scope  

- in 
  * To do list  
  * pomodoro timer  
  * authentication  
  * time tracking  
  * metadata visualization  
 
 - out  
  * This is not a project organization tool. There will not be sharing between users.  

## MVP  

MVP for our project will be functional to do list, pomodoro timer, and time tracking.  

## Functional Requirements  

1. Users can create tasks  
2. Users can start and stop pomodoro, and customize the time.  
3. Time spent on pomodoro should be tracked  
4. Tasks should support tags that will help sort the tasks.  
5. Users preferences should be saved accross sessions.  

## NON functional requirements  

1. Security - Our users should be secure from malicious actors trying to see their personal tasks  
2. Testability - All of our main features should be testable accross the application
